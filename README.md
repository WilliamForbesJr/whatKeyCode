# What Key Code?
An app to remind JavaScript developers like myself what those key codes are.
 - Live app can be found HERE

## Motivation
This was honestly a product of me never remembering keycodes and sick of Googling them up. I was inspired by the Wes Boss JavaScript 30 course to build one new little project a day. I would like to create more interactive JS apps involving key input and games so I thought this would be a fun tool to remember each keycode.
